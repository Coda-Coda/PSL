Proof Method Recommendation System(PaMpeR) is an enhancement tool to give proof engineers hints in their work.

The first part of the system is a feature extraction algorithm which obtains training data from existing Proof.
Users can also create their own training data and modify features they want to use.
Currently the features are all in binary assertion form.

The second part of the system uses a machine learning result from AFP (Archive of Formal Proof) 
and provides runtime proof method recommendation to user in a proof stage by the keyword Proof_advice.
